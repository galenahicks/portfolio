    Audio visualization & album covers for an experiment in music sampling.<br><br>
In January of 2024 I made a song using a different sample everyday for 8 days. All of my music creation up to this point had been primarily focused
on completely original music (with a few exceptions), and I felt as if sampling is almost a different artform entirely that I should explore. I had 
also taken a break from creating music in my transition from college to full time work, so I thought a week long sampling experiment would help me on both fronts.
<br><br>
I spent around 1-2 hours on each track, forcing myself to not be too much of a perfectionist or worry about details in the mixing, and instead focus on 
creating a full track that recontextualizes the original artists' songs and instrumentation through my perspective.</p>
