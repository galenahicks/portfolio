    Memphis Rap Archive [Capstone Design proj.]
</p>

<p class="subtitle">
    For my senior design capstone, I created the Memphis Rap Archive, a website that chronicles the Memphis underground hip-hop sound of the 
    90s and how it has influenced the underground internet rap scene in the 2010s, as well as the contemporary 
    Memphis rap sound and modern hip-hop in general.<br><br>

Memphis rap has had a large influence on the current sound of hip-hop, but it is often left out of the conversation;
 this website aims to take various scattered elements from across the internet to show the influence clearly and shine
  a light on an underappreciated subgenre.<br><br>

  The website's home navigation is based on the TR-808 drum machine which was instrumental in the development of the 90s Memphis rap sound.
  By integrating the TR-808's interface into the way users navigate the website, I pay homage to the originators of this niche subgenre while
  also bringing a tactile, hands-on feel to the website.

<p class="subtitle">
   Here we have some of the process involved in creating this project.<br>
   I spent an entire semester content gathering, designing, prototyping the website in Figma, and finally building the website with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.<br>
   These are a few screenshots of the process: the fully functioning prototype connections, an example of an info dump for the artist pages, moodboards, and 
   even some preliminary designs.
