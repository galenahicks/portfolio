    Language and Perception<br>[screen-based educational experiences]
</p>

<p class="subtitle">
    The goal of this project was to create an interactive visual experience showing how language can influence how we think and how
    powerful language is in general when it comes to expression and perception of the world. The experiences were geared towards people 
    interested in languages, people interested in culture, but was designed to be accessible and engaging to anyone regardless of their personal interests.<br><br>
    The project was designed for two breakpoints; desktop computer, as an interactive scroll-based website, and a large touchscreen for a museum or special exhibition setting.

<p class="subtitle">
   Here we have an example of the museum screen version how it would look on-site, as well as a video showing how it would function.
