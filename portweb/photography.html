<p class="subtitle">
    These photos are from a project I did that was examining my experience in college during the pandemic.<br>
    Each of these photos was taken in a place that I frequented by myself, trying to be somewhere other than my dorm room.
    I wanted to show how, even though these were places in which I usually found myself alone, I never felt lonely.<br>
    The "cloning" of myself was to show this feeling of being in your own company.</p>
