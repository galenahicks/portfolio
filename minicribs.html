    SFMOMA: Mini Cribs
</p>

<p class="subtitle">
    These are some of the assets I created for a new series "Mini Cribs", a collaboration between the social media and interpretative media teams at SFMOMA.
    The series is based on the "Cribs" series that lives on the SFMOMA YouTube channel, where we get in-depth looks at artists' studios and workspaces; Mini Cribs 
    does this, but takes a bit more of an informal approach and is filmed with a social-first priority.
